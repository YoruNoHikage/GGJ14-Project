		<line>At school, Charlie was bullying.</line>
		<line>A single reason : this strong russian accent.</line>
		<line>Just imagine grow up with that in the middle of the Cold War.</line>
		<line>Anyway, he found a friend in France : Augustin.</line>
		<line>Augustin lived in the middle of Montmartre.</line>
		<line>A short friendship : he killed himself in the Montmartre's stairs.</line>
